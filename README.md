# ulidexample
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate some of the many ways to generate unique identifiers.  THe name of the project deals with one of these ways, but upon more exploration, it
was decided to create an overview of other choices that are available to the software engineer



- UUID
This is probably still the most prominent form of unique identifier out there.  It has 6 variations, but version 4 is the most used

- ULID
Created as an alternative to UUID, this form can be sorted by time.

- NANOID

- CUID
The main purpose of this identification system is to avoid collisions as much as possible.
